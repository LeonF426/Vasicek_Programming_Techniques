This project is supposed to give an introduction to the Vasicek model, a model based on a mean reverting SDE that is often used to model 
interest rates (specifically short rates in our case). Each step is documented very detailed, as the focus is to learn every required 
detail of Python that we use along the way. The general structure is that the main theoretical explanations are given both in the pdf report, and the jupyter notebooks. Read in the following order:
1.) Data Prep 
2.) MLE_Fit
3.) Visualization

All methods explained there are as well given as more modular and general functions contained in the source directory such that they
can be imported and used for other usecases if needed.
