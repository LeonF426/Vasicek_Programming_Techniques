"""This file is the main.py file which is inteded to calculate one entire 'run'
of our project:
    - Explain the model and our goal --> pdf report
    - Read in Data and do cleanup --> functionalities in ./data/data_cleaning.py
    - Read in cleaned Data, use model structure and fit parameters using MLE --> ./source/fit.py
    - Use parameters and compute plots of distribution and sample trajectories --> ./source/plot_sde.py
    - Use trajectories to price derivatives --> ./source/pricing.py
    - Use derived model from main reference article to approximate term structure"""
